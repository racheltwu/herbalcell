I love this game's story and characters. It is dark and sad and serious, while at the same time being sweet, while at the same time being exciting and scary. The music is also beautiful and the gameplay is superb. The way Link has to interact so personally with all the NPCs (non-playable characters) of the game makes this one of my very favorites.

This game was the first of the Zelda series to be released in 3D and did not disappoint. It was the first Zelda game I was exposed to. My older brother and I got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas just to play this game. I was probably about 12 and I'd just watch my brother or someone else play it. I've played it a few times myself now and I really like it. Many people have named this game as the greatest of all time. Beautiful music, and great gameplay and characters.

I love this game. I love the music, the story, the gameplay, the characters, the environment, the design, everything. I played this on the Wii, not on Gamecube, and I love the new controls. The new characters, Midna especially, really grew on me. Wolf Link is also just as easy to control as regular Link, which is surprising; it would have been really easy for them to mess that part up.

I love this game's lighter, cartoony feel and crisply beautiful cel-shaded graphics. The gameplay and controls are perfect, and the puzzles, as usual for Zelda games, are very fun and interesting. Kondo's music is lovely, as always. Link is <em>very</em> expressive in this game; he has a LOT of different facial expressions. Having a vast ocean to explore and sail across is fun, realistic, and mood-setting in my opinion, not to mention unique. Other people may complain about that aspect of the game being boring or taking too long, but those people should go watch an American action movie. I thought it was an ingenious idea.

This game was, along with 7th Guest (below), the reason that CD-ROM drives in computers first became popular. Myst uses breathtaking pre-rendered 3D backgrounds and an elegant, flowing point-and-click interface. The worlds, called Ages, are full of unique and often mind-bending puzzles to solve. I love the way the understated music and sound effects just put you in the intended mood. The characters are interesting and likeable. The creators must have wild imaginations to dream up these unique worlds full of machines powered by levers, gears, water pumps, buttons, switches...
The game had sequels, but the ones that I favor are <strong>Riven, Exile, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00023XXMW/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;condition=used&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20">Revelation</a></strong>. The others (Uru and End of Ages) tried a real-time 3D engine that I thought took away too much from what Myst games are. The beautifully highly-detailed pre-rendered scenes are part of what make Myst, Myst. Myst isn't an action game, it's a stop-and-soak-in-all-the-details-and-solve-puzzles game. It's a game that could captivate your Grandma, while at the same time fascinating the most hardcore gamer.

These puzzle adventure games are just plain awesome. I've played all of them and there are close to 30 now, with new ones being regularly released every 6 months or so. I love each of them in their own way and haven't disliked a single one. If I <em>had</em> to pick a favorite, it might be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003552WU8/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003552WU8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20">Legend of the Crystal Skull</a> because of the darker tone it has. I actually think it would be awesome to work for HER Interactive (the company that makes them). They promote rational thinking and using logic and deduction to solve crimes. And they always have such unique and distinctive locales and characters, they never fail to impress me. Nancy and her friends are all likeable, and although targeted to teen girls, the games are not overly "girly" and can be enjoyed by anyone who loves mysteries.

Like Myst, this is a puzzle adventure game. It is point and click with pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D characters. This game has an excellent plot and realistic, interesting character dialogue. The main character, April Ryan, is very likeable and it's easy to relate to her. The puzzles are really fun and the pre-rendered backgrounds are really nice looking and unique.
The game has a sequel called Dreamfall, which is fun but not on quite the same level as the original in my opinion. It just doesn't have the same uniquely original feel. The graphics are really nice though, especially for being fully real-time rendered.

This game, released by LucasArts for PC, has a very interesting plot. The main character, Manny Calavera, is very charming. The <em>Dia de los Muertos</em> theme of the game is very realistic and believable, not corny or fake. It is a pleasure to listen to Manny's voice and accent, as well as the fun jazzy soundtrack. The game is real-time 3D with pre-rendered backgrounds, and has unique settings and characters. The controls can get a little annoying, but can be alleviated by using a controller. Also, the puzzles can be kindof obscure and tricky to solve sometimes; I found myself referring to a walkthrough several times to avoid becoming too frustrated. These two flaws, however, should not stop you from trying out this wonderful game.

Super Mario 64
Nintendo 64
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64
This game is the epic of the Mario series. Like Ocarina of Time, it was the first 3D game to come out in its series. As with Ocarina of Time, it did not disappoint. Great mood-setting music, easy-to-master intuitive controls, and well designed levels with puzzles and missions that challenge even the swiftest gamer are what this game is all about.

This is another very well designed Mario game. Great Mario controls, as usual. I love jumping with Mario, something you don't get to do with Link in Zelda. The introduction of the water-jet-pack was a great spice to throw in, and is very fun and intuitive to use. The overall feel of this game was lighter and more cheerful than Mario 64. The music is also upbeat and bouncy, contributing to the cheerful mood. That is something Sunshine and Wind Waker have in common. I guess Miyamoto needed a break from being so serious. :)

Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2

The latest in the Mario series, a well designed Mario game. It has several very pretty songs in the soundtrack, and all the levels are really fun. The plot wasn't very deep but none of the Mario games are, really. Since you hardly interact with the one NPC in the game, you can't really feel connected or like there's a deep plot. The focus in Mario is the gameplay, and this game has great gameplay and puzzle-worlds. It's a game you can pick up and put down easily, or go weeks without playing it. I loved the new gravity innovation; it made for some very interesting puzzles!
The sequel is just as fun if not more so, and has another breathtaking soundtrack. I loved how many hours of gameplay they gave with this one, where you can go back through all the levels to get prankster comets and then another time to get the green stars. It's a great move on their part, because they add in so many more hours of gameplay that are actually still fun (and not just repetitive and boring) really maximizing the efficiency of all the effort they put in to design all the worlds. I was really happy to discover the green stars challenge because I love searching for things (part of my love for mystery games).

Earthbound
Super Nintendo (SNES)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound
I played this SNES game a few years ago and fell in love with it. I probably love this game more than A Link to the Past. Though the main characters are kids, I see this game's subtle humor as being targeted toward teens and adults. It has incredibly unique music which mixes a lot of different synth sounds together.

This game was released on SNES, although I only played it for the first time in 2005. Even though I was introduced to the Zelda series in 3D, I still found love for this 2D game. I do not prefer it over any 3D version, but it is an awesome game for being 2D. And as usual, Kondo's music is very well done.

You can't <em>not</em> play this game. Just trust me. You get to be "Clayman" in this claymation point and click puzzle-solving game, much like <em>Myst</em>.

I must admit I have some nostalgia involved with this game. When computers were first starting to get popular, I was about 7 or 8 and my family went to a small computer store where they had a demo set up of this game. My brother and I played it a bit and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Soooo realistic! :P We bought a computer with Windows 3.1 and a CD-ROM and 7th Guest to go along with it. This game scared me when I was that age, and as a result still creeps me out today.

There are 3 of these games which are all based on Agatha Christie books: <em>And Then There Were None</em>, <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, and <em>Evil Under the Sun</em>. I highly enjoyed all of them, and love the hilarious and adorable Belgian Hercule Poirot detective character in general. I think they did a great job portraying him in the games. Fans of the British TV series will enjoy seeing David Suchet and Hugh Fraser in their familiar roles.

This is a very nice looking game. It is eerie and does a great job making you feel very alone in a creepy old house. That is the main thing I love about this game. The story is pretty interesting as well, and the ending was a bit strange but I love the graphics and mood of this game. Quite dark.

This is a series of 3 games made Jonathan Boakes, and reminds me a lot of Barrow Hill, possibly because they're both made by UK game companies. I enjoy playing his games because of the dark mood he sets. These games are all fun to play, and genuinely creepy. The 2 sequels, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9RWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9RWI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20"><em>Lights Out</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9RUU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9RUU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20"><em>Lost Souls</em></a> are just as good if not better than the first.

I love this game's unique and realistic looking scenery. The run-down, abandoned quality of the environments are visually interesting. I like to stop and just look around at all the details of the various places in the game. I found that playing in god-mode was the only way I could really enjoy the game; otherwise it was just too hard and frustrating having to reload over and over. The amount of enemies they throw at you sometimes would be insane to play without god-mode. I am not a huge fan of first person shooters; I prefer puzzle games. There are just enough puzzles in this game for me to still enjoy it, though. The scary parts are definitely effective, with monsters and zombies coming at you in dark places with huge bloodstains everywhere. The plot has always reminded me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="1984"><em>1984</em></a>, with the Combine and Breen akin to the Thought Police and Big Brother.

This game is similar to Grand Theft Auto (made by Rockstar) but set in western times and you ride horses instead of drive cars. This game gives me fond memories of my homeland, Texas, which I liked.

I've played these games since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FPV5IS/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008FPV5IS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20">Vice City</a>, and they can be pretty darn fun. Yeah, there's senseless violence and crime (and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006YVXGJQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006YVXGJQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=herbalcell-20">San Andreas</a>, frequent cursing), but hey, it's just a game. The games are mission-based, involving mostly action type gameplay and car-driving rather than puzzles. They have funny and likeable characters and great (believable) dialogue, and large open worlds to explore.

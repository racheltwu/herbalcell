<p>Weird, right? Let me explain. A guy named Joe_Cracker wrote a (terrible) Legend of Zelda script and frequently posted about it on IGN's message boards. He was confident that it would be made into a movie, despite all the criticism he received. After failing to get Cracker to face reality, three IGN individuals (Cellius_18, Sexualburgerking, and Orquiox) pretended to be John Grusd (the director of the so-bad-it's-funny 80's Zelda cartoon) and easily convinced Cracker that his movie was being made. With Cellius's expertise in music and SBK's animating skills, they collaborated and made the above animations, which follow the script exactly and are made "poorly" by intention. The whole thing is chronicled in the following IGN threads.</p>

<p>They had a website, which I actually made for them, called DancingTriforce.com (now defunct). As a thank you, they included a <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/misc/butterfly.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Butterfly drawing">butterfly drawing</a> of mine in TLOC3. See if you can spot it. =P</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-oH86K0eg" title="The Light of Courage TLOC 4">TLOC4</a> is now in production! Yay! If you want it to ever get finished, be sure to let SBK know because it's pretty much waiting on the animation to be finished.</p>

<img class="float-right" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/misc/joe_cracker.jpg" title="Robert McGee in Unknown Creature" alt="Robert McGee in Unknown Creature" />

<p>Cracker also has a <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/963fansection/index.php" title="Cracker's board">message board of his own</a> which he doesn't post on much anymore. He is pretty active on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/productions963" title="Cracker on YouTube">YouTube</a> though.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}tloc/misc-tloc-and-cracker-media.zip">here is some various media</a> (audio, images, text, and videos) from the TLOC saga. Robert McGee's full length film, <em>Unknown Creature</em>, can be seen on YouTube <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AKThaIvApGQ" title="Unknown Creature in 4 minutes">summed up in 4 minutes</a>. If you want to watch it in its entirety, email me and I may be able to help you out.</p>

<p>If you watch the movie, you will probably notice a part where Robert's brother, Andrew, says "And then I came across a creature just... gnawing into some food" in an unintentionally sing-song way. It is specifically located at 43:25, or at 2:30 in the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AKThaIvApGQ" title="Unknown Creature in 4 minutes">4 minute YouTube version</a>. This line inspired <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}tloc/cellius-came-across-a-creature.mp3" title="Cellius' Came Across a Creature">Cellius</a> and <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}tloc/sbk-came-across-a-creature.mp3" title="SBK's Came Across a Creature">SBK</a> to each write a song. When I found out and heard their versions, I was inspired to <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}tloc/rachel-came-across-a-creature.mp3" title="Rachel's Came Across a Creature Song">make one myself</a>.</p>
